<h1>why languages is my most hated subject in school</h1>
<h2>DISCLAIMER!!! THIS IS MY OPINION</h2>
<ul>
    <li id="bp">it is hard for me to understand and remember everything i learn in class</li>
    <li id="bp1">the teachers never explain in english they only speak in the launguage they teach</li>
    <li id="bp2">the class is boring and we always have to write paragraphs and never do anything else </li>
    <li id="bp3">the teachers give you loads more homework than any other lesson </li>
    <li id="bp4">and finally the teachers dont recap what happened in the last lesson so they just expect you know after telling you once</li>
</ul>
