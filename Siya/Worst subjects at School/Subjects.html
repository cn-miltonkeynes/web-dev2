    <h1>Why some subjects are worse than others</h1>
    <h2>(Subjects listed: French, Dance, PE, Maths, Music)</h2>
    <h3> French -<br> Our teacher was strict. Normally being strict is a good thing but she would spend most of the lesson
        tring to shush the other kids, when she could be continuing with the lesson for the kids who were listening, or sending
        those kids out. We basically learnt nothing. <br> She also gave out negatives alot which made the student question why, to which
        she would send the kids out for 'talking back'. This would continue for a long time. <br><br>
        Dance -<br> We did dance with our tutor, who already seemed to not like half the class. Our class was always slow at changing,
        so she would spend 15 mins telling us how 'disappointed' she is in us and how she's sorry for the kids who try... who in reality
        is none of us, since no one in my class wants to dance. (But our tutor was nice nevertheless)<br><br>
        PE -<br> Teacher was nice but nobody, except some sporty kids, actually liked PE. You have to get sweaty and our teacher usually
        makes us run 800 metres.</be></h3
